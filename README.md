# Theory of Computation Simulator 🎓

## Overview

The Theory of Computation Simulator is an interactive web-based platform designed to visualize and understand core computational models:

- Context-Free Grammar (CFG)
- Pushdown Automata (PDA)
- Turing Machine (TM)

The system emphasizes clarity, correctness, and step-by-step execution, allowing users to explore how abstract computational models operate in practice.

## Objectives

- To provide an intuitive interface for exploring formal computation models  
- To bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical understanding  
- To enable step-by-step visualization of computation processes  
- To ensure correctness through structured simulation and validation

- Step-by-step and fast execution modes
- Loop detection and step limit safeguards
- Execution trace panel
- Predefined machines:
  - String reversal
  - Binary increment
  - Palindrome checker
  - Unary addition / subtraction
  - Even number of 1s
- Membership-based result evaluation

## System Design 🧠

The simulator is structured into three layers:

- **Input Layer** → User-defined grammar, automaton, or machine  
- **Simulation Engine** → Executes transitions and computations  
- **Visualization Layer** → Displays derivations, stack, and tape  

### Layout Structure

- **Left Panel** → Example explorer & input configuration  
- **Center Panel** → Visualization (Tree / Stack / Tape)  
- **Right Panel** → Execution trace and explanations  
- **Bottom Control Bar** → Persistent execution controls  

---

## Execution Controls 🎮

A unified control system is provided across all modules:

- Run  
- Step  
- Pause  
- Reset  
- Speed Control (0.5x / 1x / 2x)

Controls are fixed at the bottom center for consistent accessibility.

## Performance & Stability ⚙️

To ensure smooth execution:

- Step limits prevent infinite computation  
- Loop detection avoids non-terminating behavior  
- Asynchronous execution prevents UI freezing  
- Fail-fast validation filters invalid inputs early  
- Partial rendering (e.g., tape window) improves performance  

---

## Correctness Approach ✅

The simulator ensures correctness using:

- Formal transition-based computation  
- Strict acceptance conditions:
  - Input must be fully consumed  
  - Acceptance by final state or empty stack  
- Internal structural validation (hidden from UI) to prevent false acceptance  

---

## Usage 🧪

1. Select a simulator (CFG / PDA / TM)  
2. Choose a predefined example or define your own  
3. Enter an input string  
4. Run simulation using:
   - Step Mode → detailed execution  
   - Fast Mode → instant result  
5. Observe visualization and execution trace
